    "title": "Fanjol",
    "bio": "Born in Nancy, Fanjol lives and works in Paris. A sculptor above all, she creates sand-cast bronzes in limited editions of eight. Over one hundred original works to her name.\n\nHer favorite themes: couples, family, motherhood, love, dance. Between figuration and abstraction, her sculptures carry a profound sensuality, blending curves and clean lines.\n\nHer primary goal: never losing the initial emotion of inspiration. Curves, arches, intertwined forms — Fanjol seeks to make emotion omnipresent.\n\nA member of the Salon d'Automne at the Grand Palais since 1987, her works are part of private and public collections in France, Germany, Belgium, USA, Finland, Israel, Japan, Luxembourg, Qatar, and Switzerland. She has also collaborated with Daum crystal on the Cœurs sculpture.",
